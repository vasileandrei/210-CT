1.	The code will have 3 columns, by select the following 3 queries:
•	Screen name
•	Retweets (as total_retweets)
•	The number of tweets (as tweet_count)
The output will be ordered descending, first being the most retweeted “tweet”.

2.	text <- input “string”
split text into n rows 
split words by splitting the rows

•	Mapping:
split words from rows
count = 0
for word in row:
    count += 1

•	Sort:
lst = [] // empty list, also there are N lists
for word in row:
    if word in row:
        lst append [word]
// groups the same words in lists

•	Reduce:
reduce = len(lst) // how many words are in the lists
display word and len(lst)
// the results will join the same machine and print the count of the words //

4.	Depending on what show or match was before broadcasted, I would analyse the public and their interests and display the product(s). For example if the Premier League was live, I would advertise objects that interests man, that are between 5 and 60 years old, because I think this is the most common public, that would watch the channel. Objects that fit to this category are: beer, sports, extreme sports and barbeques. I would advertise more objects, when the most important matches and playing and less when it is not that important. Being an important match would attract more people, so the product would get significantly more attention, because of the big audience.
